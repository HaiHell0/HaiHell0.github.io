        <p class="fs-3"> My name is Hai and I am an international student from Vietnam. My favorite American food are hashbrowns 
            followed very closely by potpies. I generally don't like American food. It is too fatty and makes me feel sick.
        </p><br>
        <p class="fs-3">
            My hobbies include farming. I grow herbs and small vegetables hydroponically. I think its a very rewarding pasttime and
            is a good way to work on my patience and discipline
        </p><br>
        <p class="fs-3">
            One fun fact about me is I like the color black, not because it looks particularly nice or anything but rather it is the fact that it is the lack of color.
            If only they made clothes in Vantablack, I would wear that everyday to campus.
